Preference in case of Dates;
Date values that are specfied take precedence over Date values that are not not specfied

In case of a conflict in specfied Dates;
Earliest Date takes precedence

I have provided an example for Ex-Date, picking up the earliest valid value in Database_splits.xlsx

split_from & split_to have been now specfied as NOT NULL. 
Reject Rows that do not have split_to:split_from ratio

In case of all other conflicts;
A valid value takes precedence over No value.
